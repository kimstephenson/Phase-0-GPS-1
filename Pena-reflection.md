What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
-I struggled with pull request via Github and merging branches with the master branch.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guide went through all the step very slowly and cleared up pull request and merges for me.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We ask if there was a way to automatically pull from the repo to your local repo clone.
We asked what does "origin" mean during pull request.

What still confuses you about Git?
I think I just need to go through the process I couple more times for it to be seamless.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I ejoyed it. I liked beig able to ask questions and have someone there to be able to answer them for me.
