* Prior to the GPS session, I felt like I pretty much understood most of the Git concepts but working through them with a partner helped solidify them.
* The concepts of pushing and pulling from a local repository to a GitHub repository were clarified.
* I asked my pair and my guide to check my terminal commands and syntax, and I asked my guide some specific questions about GitHub workflow.
* I feel like all of the concepts that we've covered about Git so far are pretty clear to me.
* My first experience of pairing was a good one. My pair and I worked well together and she was a very easy and welcoming person to collaborate with.
